# Graph Representation Learning

## Courses

1. [CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn)
This course, starts with a basic overiview of graph thoery before diving deep into all the significant development in GraphML field.

2. [Week 13 â€“ Lecture: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)](https://youtu.be/Iiv9R6BjxHM)
This is not a course but rather a lecture by Xavier Bresson taken from NYU Deep Learning course. It will give brief insight about different methods in GraphML.
