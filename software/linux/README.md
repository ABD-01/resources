## Linux Tutorials
- If you are a beginner then you must go through [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) website. It is an intutive website which covers all the basic commands.
- [Linux productivity tips: "Missing Semester" from MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J) is good for people who like video lectures. After doing this course, you will have good working knowledge of Linux.

## Books 
- [How Linux Works â€“ What Every Superuser Should Know](https://www.amazon.in/How-Linux-Works-Superuser-Should/dp/1593275676#:~:text=In%20this%20completely%20revised%20second,workings%20of%20the%20operating%20system.&text=How%20Linux%20boots%2C%20from%20boot,%2C%20Upstart%2C%20and%20System%20V))

## Tips
- Linux is something which you cant learn through books alone. Keep using linux as much as possible and try to do everything on terminal alone. 
- We would recommend installing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for best experience.
