## Machine Learning

##### An effort to make computers think, and learn from experience like humans do, for all sorts of applications from self driving cars, to trading stocks, and writing stories.

### Course: 

[**Deep Learning Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?)

The Deep Learning Specialization, presented by Andrew Ng, is a collection of five courses, each offering a good requiem of required concepts and implementations for almost all kinds of basic deep learning. The contents and goals of each of the courses are further explained below.

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) aims at explaining the basics of neural networks and deep learning, starting from very basic problems like linear and logistic regression. It helps one understand and actually implement neural networks and basic optimization algorithms from scratch, mainly in NumPy. Using an analogy, this course actually teaches you to bake from scratch including how to use an oven.

* [Improving Deep Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning) focuses more on improving the performance of neural networks by employing efficient optimization and normalization algorithms. If the first course is a course that teaches you baking, then this one teaches you how and where to use which ingredient to get the best results. However, the last few assignments are based on TensorFlow.

* [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning) is a course that helps one develop an intuition as to which architectures and optimization algorithms would work best for a given machine learning problem. Further, it also covers the basics of transfer learning and multi-task learning. It is a course oriented more towards industrial and result oriented practices. So, this is a course that teaches you to industrialize your bakery.

* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) brings to the table, the most fundamental and powerful tools used in almost all kinds of deep learning problems that are coupled with image processing or even signal processing at times. The course covers all the basics and is almost a must for anyone planning to work with images and deep learning. The assignments are in NumPy and TensorFlow. So this course teaches you how to bake a cake because who doesnâ€™t like cake.

* [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) is a course that explains recurrent neural networks and other architectures and techniques used in applying deep learning on sequential data. It focuses more on Natural Language Processing and audio signal processing which is a completely different and rather nascent domain of deep learning. The assignments use NumPy. This is like learning to bake pizzas.

A healthy approach, containing a good mix of results and fairly decent understanding would be to first complete the first two courses, then study the fourth one along with a bit of Image Processing and Computer vision followed by a small project using NumPy, from scratch, followed by an introductory project like [The Digit Classifier](http://www.ivlabs.in/mnist.html) using either PyTorch or TensorFlow.The fifth course can be a bit heavy if done before implementing a project or two using Image Processing and Deep Learning even though it deals with a very different paradigm. The third course, however, holds little potential with respect to research-oriented learning.

**Example:** A robot that is capable of following a person around, a robot that can climb stairs, and lots, lots more.
